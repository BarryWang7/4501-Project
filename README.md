We choosed data from zip code 10027 to conduct our analysis. 

To analyze the top 10 causes of call to 311, we first filtered out the for zip code 10027 and counted the number of each complaint type to find the top 10.The top 10 causes are Noise - Residential, Noise - Street/Sidewalk, HEAT/HOT WATER, Illegal Parking, Non-Emergency Police Matter, Illegal Fireworks, Noise - Vehicle,              UNSANITARY CONDITION, PLUMBING, and Noise.  

To analyze the illegal parking incidents rate, we counted the total number of complaint in zip code 10027 and the number of complaint associated with "Illegal parking" and calculated the ratio of illegal parking as a fraction of all incidents in 10027.  Using the same method, we calculated the total fraction of parking incidents across all zip codes. By comparing the two ratios, the results shows the parking incidents in 10027 is lower than the ratio across the whole city.
